"Against Interpretation" by Susan Sontag
In Susan Sontag’s essay ‘Against Interpretation,’ she criticizes our intellectual tendency to interpret artworks rather than directly perceive them through the senses. 
I beleive that Sontag things that out personal interpretations of the art are taking away from it's natural beauty.
I like finding the hidden meaning in art, I beleive it makes us look deeper into what were viewing and possibly helps us connect it to our lives.
I beleive that overall its more important to just enjoy the art. 
 Sontag posits an “erotics of art,” inspiring us to admire the shape, cloth quality and sensuality in a piece instead of looking for significance that is impossible to see.
I believe that SOntag is trying to say that we should intreprate all works of art on a person level
In conclusion, I believe that her point of view is very unique and because of that a lot of people will disagree on it
