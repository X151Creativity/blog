"Against Interpretation" by Susan Sontag
I feel that the main point of the article, "Against Interpretation" by Susan Sontag, is to not over look the important of what the artist has created. 
My understanding is that Songtag believes that many times the viewer of a piece of art over looks for the hidden mean instead of enjoying the beauty of the art. 
I can agree with this point of view, but I also do enjoy finding the hiddene meaning of the artwork. 
To me, it can be view as equally important on finding the hidden meaning of an artwork and to just enjoy the artwork. 
From page 3, "Thus, interpretation is not (as most people assume) an absolute value, a gesture of mind situated in some timeless realm of capabil- ities." 
I feel that Sontag is trying to say that the inerpretation is personal and could change a different points of a person's life. 
Overal, I could see if you agree or disagree with her point of view, because as you can read from my post, I have mixed opinions on the subject as well.
