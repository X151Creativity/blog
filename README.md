This repository provides a web site template for communities in need of a free, easy-to-configure online exhibit.

The `_config.yml` file contains settings for exhibit info, font, and color choices that affect the entire web site.

Each item in the collection has an item ID (no spaces or punctuation) has one or more files associated with it (e.g. `0001.md`, in the following places:

- The `_items` folder contains one `.md` file for each item in the archive collection. These "markdown" files contain information in text form that distribute information to different folders/files in the community-archive theme, which auto-generate a web page for each individual item, drawing in photos and other info from the other file locations.
- The `/assets/items/` folder contains images named for each item (e.g. `0001_01.jpg` and `0001_02.jpg` would display 2 photos for item 0001)
