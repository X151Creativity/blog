“Spinning” by Tillie Walden is an incredible portrayal of Tillie’s life growing up, while not being solely about any particular aspect. She talks largely about her ice skating, sexuality, and womanhood. These are seemingly disconnected topics, but Tillie weaves them together to show her pain during her youth.

It is blindingly clear from page 2 that Tillie doesn’t have the best relationship with ice skating, “And as much as it makes me cringe, an ice rink will always be a familiar place. It smells like hockey sweat and artificial cold. Every rink smells the same. They look the same, too. Everything feels just like it used to and I want to run away.” This sentiment is carried throughout the book, and yet we watch as Tillie throws herself into skating year after year. I often wondered why Tillie kept skating as I read the book, as she doesn’t love it. “It wasn’t strict or beautiful or energizing anymore. Now it just felt dull and exhausting. I couldn’t understand why I should keep skating after it lost all of it’s shine,” (139). However, when rereading, I realized she does care about skating. After pouring so much time into practice, at some point skating has tied itself up tightly into her identity. While it’s clear she doesn’t love it, she does feel as though it’s a part of her. We can see on page 141 how she’s bothered by getting 2nd place rather than 1st. “I wanted to chase that high – that thrill of success,” (161). While being good at skating is important to her, we can see it’s not enough to bring her happiness, because she doesn’t truly enjoy it. This complicated relationship between her identity and skating seems to be a reason why she doesn’t quit earlier.

Tillie knew she was gay since she was 5, (70), and her sexuality plays an interesting role in the book. It is tied up with her relationship to skating, as she says, “Skating presented a strange debacle. I disliked the femininity of it all yet was attracted to it nonetheless, (71). When Tillie starts dating Rae, it seems like her life has turned a corner, “Something had gone right, finally,” (219). Her relationship with Rae is similar to skating, in that it is an unhealthy way to gain true happiness. While Tillie enjoys being with Rae, this doesn’t make her truly happy. On page 225, Tillie says, “I thought with synchro going well that skating would be more bearable. But synchro was only twice a week. Figure skating still took up most of my time. And that part of my skating life was slowly decaying.” Tillie is now in a relationship with Rae and has just gotten on the “adult” team for synchro, but is still unhappy. Pages 228-230 appear to be about Tillie’s coping mechanism for the cold of the rink, but seem to also represent a coping mechanism for her life. On top of this, she has to deal with homophobia in the people around her. Pages 246-253 are a sad montage of how her somewhat unwilling coming out is received by her mom, brother, and friends, dad, and cello tutor. While her cello tutor is supportive and her dad tries to be, I was most shocked at the responses of her mom and brother. I think this section is indicative that Tillie is rather unsupported, even at the core of her being.

Spinning also covers Tillie dealing with being a woman. This is discussed in many ways, like the way skating sexualizes girls and unwanted attention from men. Tillie realizes more and more as she gets older how wrong her skating uniform feels. Makeup, no underwear, band-aids, tights, short dresses. “I was starting to realize that skating wasn’t what it seemed. I always thought of it as simply a sport. But with that sport came a lifestyle. And it wasn’t optional,” (262). I think this realization Tillie has is common among girls’ activities: it comes with the underlying understanding that women are meant to be sexy. Her skating doesn’t put young girls in lingerie, but it comes close enough that the meaning is still understood. “If we were boys, we could wear pants”, (264). But as she says on page 264, “But it felt too big to fight.” This message that has been ingrained in Tillie through her skating is likely why she responds to unwanted male attention the way she does throughout the book. When her SAT tutor assaults her, she fights enough so that he stops, and then continues on as if it didn’t happen. She has learned from skating that she is to be perceived sexually, and since she wore a tank top to tutoring, it is inevitable that she was assaulted.
