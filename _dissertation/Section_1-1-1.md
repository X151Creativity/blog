This chapter investigates the non-scientific visual culture around tuberculosis at the turn of the twentieth century. In the introduction, I spent time to outline the theoretical significance of this project, but decided to omit some discussion as to the historical context of the project as that chapter’s scope ballooned out of scope. This decision was born from trying to balance the dissertation for an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use interdisciplinary to describe a conversation with and adoption of different methods practiced by a range of academic fields."><b>interdisciplinary</b></span> audience, who may be unfamiliar with the history of medicine and the history of tuberculosis care in English speaking nations. It was also born from a more realistic view: the <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Corpus here refers to the creation of a collection of written texts which are used for quantitative analysis. Most commonly, corpuses are constructed for computational linguistic studies, but are also used by digital humanists interested in textual analysis.">corpus</span></b> of texts from which this dissertation uses to make its claims were filled with all sorts of non-scientific visual material, which demanded attention.

When I began this project in earnest in 2021 I had not expected the scale and influence that tuberculosis had on the broader cultures in the period of inquiry. As a reader of Michel Foucault and follower of his discursive model, I generally thought that the power systems---the doctors, the institutions, the juridical apparatuses, and so on---would have more broadly defined the ways of knowing the disease, the diseased, and the apparatuses of care.[^fn1] This discursive formation was, of course, active in the scientific and public interventions against the disease, and bled into the cultural understandings of tuberculosis, but it was one discourse among many. The main figures whose authority led to broad understandings of the disease were doctors; however, these ways of seeing were not the only ones that emerged in my visual analysis.[^fn2]

As I built the <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Corpus here refers to the creation of a collection of written texts which are used for quantitative analysis.

In developing an interpretive <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Corpus here refers to the creation of a collection of written texts which are used for quantitative analysis.

What does a child selling postage seals (fig. 1), an architectural floor-plan for a sanatorium (fig. 2), an image of a filthy room (fig. 3), images of children studying in heavy coats (fig. 4), and a photograph of a cottage (fig. 5) have to do with the scientific understandings of the disease? Moreover, how could these images have anything to be related to the clinical and pathological images which I will discuss in the next chapter (2.0.0)?

Even as I foreground these non-specimen objects, I cannot claim that this chapter will be able to give each of them the kind of care that they deserve. Scoping is a constant concern to which I concede this chapter as a taster: more work is to be done in visual culture and tuberculosis, and it is outside this project to go into great detail into objects like christmas seals, disparaging illustrations of flappers, and museum-like hygiene posters. Instead, I want to use these case studies---looking at the sanatorium ([1.2.0](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1/#1.2.0)), hygiene ([1.3.0](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1/#1.3.0)), medical portraiture (1.4.0), and the architectural solution to tuberculosis (1.5.0)---as bridges into thinking about the ideologies which circle around the disease but which will be harder to tease out when looking at visual specimens (2.0.0) and autopsies (3.x.x).

This section also helps me push to contextualize and complicate <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to the ways doctors will objectify their patients by focusing on supposedly aberrant symptoms and their relationship to an idealized “normal” human body.">clinical vision</span></b>, arguing instead for what are multiple clinical and medical visualities. It is worth remembering that Foucault, our French historian-philosopher friend, developed <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to the ways doctors will objectify their patients by focusing on supposedly aberrant symptoms and their relationship to an idealized “normal” human body.">clinical vision</span></b> early in his academic life, while he was still in his structuralist phase. This means that while there are aspects of some of his more concise (and extremely helpful)  definitions of <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Power, for Foucault, refers to the knowledge systems which create cultural understandings of objects and practices. These systems define objects in particular ways, which produce effects in the lived lives of subjects.">discourse and power</span></b>, he had not come to these conclusions when writing *Birth of the Clinic*.[^fn3] That book was relatively narrow as compared the wide-sweeping analysis which *Discipline and Punish* employed. *Birth of the Clinic* looks at a narrow moment in French medicine which proved to be crucially important for medical epistemics in the modern period, helping scholars like myself understand the cascading horrors that is the history of medicine. Because Foucault’s focus was more narrow in this book, there were gaps concerning the other kinds of medical interventions, cultures, subjects, and so on, and the various nuances that they entail. The <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to the ways doctors will objectify their patients by focusing on supposedly aberrant symptoms and their relationship to an idealized “normal” human body.">clinical gaze</span></b> is very helpful, but it is not all encompassing.

As public historians have argued for decades, the top-down approach (which prioritizes and glamorizes doctors and medical progressivism)[^fn4] to understanding medicine’s past erases the lived experience of patients. While patients were gazed at, many gazed back, articulating different scales of resistance to dominant epistemic regimes.[^fn5] For <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to the ways doctors will objectify their patients by focusing on supposedly aberrant symptoms and their relationship to an idealized “normal” human body.">clinical vision</span></b>, there is at least some slippage within which <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="While I am using the term actor, I am not explicitly pointing toward its use in non-hierarchical posthuman approaches to culture. Actor means, in this study, almost exclusively human beings and human run institutions.">actors</span></b> can express their own meanings, ideas, and self constructions.[^fn6] 

The limits of <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to the ways doctors will objectify their patients by focusing on supposedly aberrant symptoms and their relationship to an idealized “normal” human body.">clinical vision</span></b> compound when considering the cultural weight a disease like tuberculosis had at certain moments in time. Much has been written as to the ways tuberculosis evoked a kind of poetic, <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Power, for Foucault, refers to the knowledge systems which create cultural understandings of objects and practices. These systems define objects in particular ways, which produce effects in the lived lives of subjects.">Romantic</span></b> disposition.[^fn7] Susan Sontag famously wrote about how the metaphors for health are projected onto patients, using tuberculosis’ image at the turn of the twentieth century to contrast with the isolating experience of cancer care in the 1970s.[^fn8] Scientific discourse is but one of the discussions which contests, overlaps, influences, absorbs, or contradicts these metaphors, as meaning is made about disease through varied avenues and for different needs.

To understand these competing discourses, I borrow a lenticular approach to visuality. This idea, first articulated by Tara McPherson, describes how two seemingly opposed ideas can be inextricably bound, even while they seem completely at odds. Using the metaphor of a lenticular postcard with two images as her main metaphor, she writes, “[a]s critics, we can read these two images (and the connections between them) in a variety of ways, but the structural logic of the [lenticular postcard] itself makes joining the two images within one view difficult if not impossible, even as it conjoins them at a structural level.”[^fn9]  This logic helps me think of how the cultures of health are structurally linked to the sciences which study disease; moreover, it helps me think of the curious systems, practices, and institutions which become entangled with health. It helps me understand how conceptions of health can be leveraged for political gain, used to forward xenophobic or eugenicist ideologies, and be rallied for the amassing of capital.

Returning to Foucault, and why the <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to the ways doctors will objectify their patients by focusing on supposedly aberrant symptoms and their relationship to an idealized “normal” human body.">clinical gaze</span></b> is still so helpful for this project, there is, in *Birth of the Clinic*, a notion that the ways that doctors treat patients is both *constructed* and *dehumanizing*. In part, it has helped medical historians and medical humanists to question the structures and epistemic practices which historically guided medicine and inform our contemporary health cultures.[^fn10] It also gives us a framework to think about how that mode of seeing maintains and reinforces particular modes of othering. I see this project, and the interventions into health afforded by media studies more broadly, as a way to thread the needle between the various approaches the medicine’s past: while I approach the prominent medical figures in the various discourses around health, I do not want to enshrine them, nor rely entirely on their thinking to make my conclusions; I also hope to think of patients as being both objects (ala <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to the ways doctors will objectify their patients by focusing on supposedly aberrant symptoms and their relationship to an idealized “normal” human body.">clinical vision</span></b>) but also <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="While I am using the term actor, I am not explicitly pointing toward its use in non-hierarchical posthuman approaches to culture. Actor means, in this study, almost exclusively human beings and human run institutions.">actors</span></b> (ala public health) navigating systems which purport to help them, but which primarily is focused on capitalizing and reifying its own cultural and paradigmatic significance.

This chapter, then, will investigate the non-specimen images in the tuberculosis <b><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="tooltip-mouseover" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Corpus here refers to the creation of a collection of written texts which are used for quantitative analysis. Most commonly, corpuses are constructed for computational linguistic studies, but are also used by digital humanists interested in textual analysis.">corpus</span></b> and use them to make some broad claims about the cultures around tuberculosis, and the multiple visualities which were engaged by various peoples between the years 1882 and 1926. In the next chapter (2.0.0), I will go into more detail about how these visualities play out in the more scientific, more specimen-based research into the disease. Just as those images are divorced and black boxed from the bodies from which they were extracted, they have been intentionally served from the culture in which they were made. This chapter will help fill some gaps which will bring some historicity back to the seeming neutrality of the biomedical specimen, and help explain how and why that image is leveraged in the particular moments it is used.
