title: Feedback on "The Writers Strike"
excerpt:

One of the reasons why we have stressed the concept of *creative labor* in this class is to stress the value which creatives have for their industries. We covered the writers strike[^1] to engage with the reality that creative work is so central to our cultures, but that those who do that work (writers, actors, editors, directors and other creatives in many industries) are unfairly compensated for their time. The writers' strike gives a good example of the reality of this work, as well as an example of how communities of creators have worked to protect themselves and their industry.

A bit of context is warranted, because this is the first major strike since the 2008 writers strike. In the fifteen years since that strike ended, it was blamed for a number of changes in the film industry. The rise of reality television (brought on by the lack of a need for writers and low production costs), and the death of mid-budget films (so the only films that are made today are 100 million dollar blockbusters, or low-budget indies) were the result of that strike, and the discourse around the strike at the time was one where the union's demands hampered the entire industry.

In light of this history, then, the tenor of how the strike was covered is interesting. The negativity toward the Writers Guild of America (WGA) in the previous strike, and the positivity expressed by public sentiment this time around may correspond with the relative uptick of labor movements in the post-pandemic period. It may also be that the political and media savviness of the WGA is more on point this time around.

In his blog post, Wyatt summarizes the needs of the writers:

>In the modern era, we are seeing a very big shift from watching shows on television to watching them on different streaming platforms, such as Netflix or Hulu. As a result of this shift, writers have to work harder to find a job and maintain a job. There is less work for writers to do, and they find themselves moving jobs very frequently. Additionally, there has been a lack of residuals for the writers who are creating these shows. In 1960, there was a big writers strike concerning the lack of residuals for the writers of these shows. Certain writers were feeling like they were being underpaid and treated unfairly when the show that they created started to gain popularity. As a result of this strike, writers started to gain more residuals and started to get the credit that they deserve. However, after many years of development in the television industry, there is still an issue with how writers are being treated. Writers are getting underpaid for the work that they are doing towards these shows, and they are not getting the respect or the pay that they deserve.

The issue with the writers strike are structural. First is a byproduct of how the industry operates, which Khushi describes in her post:

>In creative jobs, in the entertainment industry, there is often a long dry period when artists have no work and depend on their last project income and their savings. It is unjust that they’re not fairly compensated for the amount of traction their content brings for the production. I believe that there must be flowing work or allowed opportunities, or a program for all writers and other artists to be compensated for the efforts they put in, which doesn’t make them seasonally unemployed.

The lack of constant work corresponds with another issue around the respect for writers' labor and agency over their work. As Isabella writes in her blog post,

>I feel when it comes to the strike, why does it take so long for change? Why would someone want it worse for others? For what? To prove that it’s tough. Why make it difficult because others had it difficult? I believe in effort, but I also believe that there are ways to no longer suffer. Relating the strike to creativity is that it doesn’t get more creative than to conjure a story from your mind and releasing it out, what started out as paper to turn into something on screen.

The crisis is that the value of the work itself seems to be unrelated to the profit of the writers' various platforms, and the value the writers create with their labor is unrecognized and jeopardized as a result. Moreover, as Azzam points out in his blog post, there is a disparity between writers:

>One area of potential confusion arises from the juxtaposition of the relatively high average income of WGA members with the depiction of financial instability and struggle. This contrast may lead to questions about the distribution of income within the industry and the sustainability of such a model. Furthermore, the notion that no contract can fully address the challenges posed by the industry's evolution underscores the complexity of the situation and the need for ongoing dialogue and adaptation beyond the strike.

The boom or bust nature of the work, and the way pay gets allocated to the top (and to those whose contracts are tied to older residual calculations), requires nuance and attention. Hollywood should not be a place where only the rich and well connected can play.[^2] The disparities between earners, and the precarity of breaking into the industry, require continued reexamination.

[^1]: Honestly I'm not sure if it is "writers strike" or "writers' strike". I've decided to keep it without the apostrophe for sake of cleanliness, and because it matches the Writers Guild of America's use of the apostrophe.

[^2]: It is worth noting that many actors, writers, directors, and other stars benefitted from their family's connections and wealth. For an example Robert Downey Jr.'s father was a prominent director; and Emily Deschanel and Zooey Deschanel's father was an Oscar winning cinematographer.
