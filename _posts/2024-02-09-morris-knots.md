I think that the thesis of this text significantly revolves around the presence of knots, and how the author speaks about her personally teaching how to tie knots as well as the establishment of a “knot laboratory “ and she really speaks her heart about a knot, something that neither you nor I would bat an eye too and something that we would find very insignificant. However, to her, it’s her whole world which I found very interesting. She’s so passionate about tying a knot in a piece of rope and it really goes to show how some people, find joy and something that somebody else would not even be able to imagine. The author speaks a lot about the significance of knots in her life and states that it’s not just a skill that is practical, but it also signifies personal development in her life. Through the author's life and through the stories that she tells in this piece, we are given the opportunity to be a “fly on the wall” and look into her history. The author speaks a lot about the importance of recognizing and seeing that knots are not, no pun intended, just insignificant things. They are not just loops in a piece of rope, they are quite significant actually, and she emphasizes throughout the entire work, how symbolic and interesting they are to her. She speaks a lot about the educational value of knots for children, and the essay emphasizes and ensures that we understand that knots are not just knots. Still, it allows children to explore the mathematical concepts present in a playful and creative way. Making knots allows children to think about and consider combination, separation, and lots of other concepts that on the surface we wouldn't even consider. I found this concept interesting, but I didn't really agree. Throughout the essay she addresses "play" a lot and how children in the knot lab play with strings and knots, and her main point is that these knots aren't just fun, they're a sense of structure to develop skills within these kids relating to mathematical development and a way to explore those mathematical concepts. In the way that knots can be creative, there being many types of knots and combinations, that align with the enjoyment of playing with knots. The playful way of looking at knots in the knot lab mirrors what Donald Winnicott says in his "Playing and Reality" where he states that play is essential in a child's development. When Jill is going through her parents' divorce she uses knots as a form of play and uses them as something to cope with her pain. She gets super into her knots, and invests a ton of time and effort into them. The essay suggests that not only are these knots creative, they help repair her mind from the trauma that she is experiencing.
