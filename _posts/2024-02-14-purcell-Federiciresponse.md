title: “Feedback on the Essay on Reproductive Labor”

One of the reasons I wanted to include this essay in our class is to bring up, and keep bringing up, the kinds of uncompensated labor which is so common in our lives. Federici's critique of second wave feminism is one which peels back the cover of all sorts of interlinked exploitative systems which we all have to go along with (whether we like it or not). It also helps point to the broad inequities in our culture, which harm some people and which others can happily ignore.

In some of my other responses, I took lengthy quotes from each person's blog post, but for this one I want to do something different: I want to take some strands of thought and challenge the writers (and the class as a whole) to think a bit further regarding the effects of an exploitative practice like reproductive labor.

Anna [writes, of her own mother](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/02/01/Wrasse-Federici-Article-Response.html),

>I loved having her home and certainly would have missed her if she had chosen to work full time or part time. My mom prioritized family over everything else and chose to be a stay at home mother; the choice was not forced upon her. However, there is definitely a cost for any parent who is a stay at home parent, and one of the largest ones that I can see, is that there ends up being less time for yourself because your role is a constant one that you cannot step away from once you drive away from work.

I wanted to start with Anna's response because it reflects my own mother's experience (at least as I saw it when growing up). I want to tease apart the implicit decision which undergird the stay-at-home job. My own mother stayed home and was miserable: she'd spend her days on AOL chat rooms and playing casual games; she was an active member of the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), but mostly as a way to be social in an otherwise stifling and lonely decade. (She returned to the workforce when I was in high school, and has been much more fulfilled in that role, even though it has its own problems.)

I bring this up because I have been reflecting on my own childhood more recently, and because it helps me better understand the rage which Federici and her mother feel. It also helps me have more empathy for my mother, who I love, but sometimes have difficulty with, because my teenage years were quite difficult for both of us.

Alaina, [in her post](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/02/02/Johnson-The-Lockdown-Showed-How-the-Economy-Exploits-Women-She-Already-Knew.html), notes the difficulty expressed by her own mother during the pandemic, one which Alaina was able to assist with. She writes, of her mother,

>She was lucky enough to have a stable income and help around the house to keep things at bay, but it makes me wonder about all of the other mothers. The underprivileged, the minorities, the poor. This article made me think about single mothers and how they can barely provide for their children through their low paying jobs and the expenses of childcare. The idea that even now, many women come home from their full time job just to do what Frederici calls “the 2nd shift” of cleaning, cooking, housekeeping, and taking care of children and spouses.

I find Alaina's response to be quite thoughtful because it can tease out the difficulty these systems place on ourselves and others. **It is exhausting to be a person right now**, and add in the responsibilities to raise and care for others, to provide the space for them to rest while not having the space yourself is a recipe for burnout and dispair. Some of this exhaustion is driven by all the other things we need to do: the little chores and practices which keep our lives afloat, but which take time and energy away from things that can make us whole.

As I finish this response, I want to point to the kinds of layered precarities which start to arise when looking at these labor structures. Amir wites,

>Just to think, not only were white collar workers harmed in the pandemic by losing their jobs, but also by losing out on pay; but blue collar workers, independent contractors and many others were harmed as well. For Blue collar workers, their hourly wages decreased due to the lack of work needed. As for independent contractors, they are able to charge however much they feel is necessary for their services. For many people during the pandemic people didn’t have money to spend on house cleaning or other independent contracted services, causing this group of people to lose out.

One of the additional thorns in Federici's work is that it is not just the unpaid household labor of stay-at-home moms, but that everything builds upon this unpaid labor, and how the dominaos fall when that work is not able to be done.

I want to use Amir's example to think in the reverse: how much of the work for every sector is done by essential workers to make it possible for contractors, white collar and blue collar workers? The economy shut down, but children had to be fed and clothes and bathed, the weeds needed to be pulled, and someone had to make the meals. There was still economic activity, even if it was not measured by the factors that determine growth and health in an economy.
