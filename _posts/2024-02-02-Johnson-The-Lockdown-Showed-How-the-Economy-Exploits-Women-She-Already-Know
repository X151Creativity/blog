  In Jordan Kisner’s article, The Lockdown Showed How the Economy Exploits Women. She Already Knew, follows conversations between the author, Kisner, and Silvia Frederici, who she deems an “influential socialist feminist,” on their walks in Prospect Park. Frederici specializes as a theorist of domestic labor. During their walks, Kisner decided she wanted to know more about Frederici’s insights since more of her work was appearing amidst COVID-19 concerning domestic labor and “essential” workers. Themes that Frederici wrote about, topics that hadn’t been popularized in years, and her support for feminism were starting to swirl in all types of communities. This article was written to dive into some of those now-popular ideas from Frederici, which are now relevant to the domestic and reproductive labor crisis that COVID-19 caused.
  Frederici is an advocate for domestic labor, and helped create the Wages for Housework in the 1970’s. Domestic labor or reproductive labor is a word she uses to describe self sustaining work, like raising children, keeping everyone well fed and cared for, house work, taking care of the elderly, etc. She believes this is essential work. What was deemed “essential” during the pandemic was widely debated. People were laid off from countless jobs due to them being “unessential” when in reality, any job is essential to pay bills and afford to live in such an expensive economy. The essential job of caring for your home, your family, your job, and yourself is too big of a burden to put on just one person, but it is all too often put solely on women. 
  Before the pandemic, women’s empowerment was measured by the work they did outside of their home, meaning they needed to outsource care for their home and children. At the start of the pandemic, schools were shut down and the children were sent home to do online schoolwork. The schools remained closed for around a year before going back full time. If the children aren’t at school, someone must be home to watch them. There were no daycares or after school programs to send them to, so the only option was for a parent or guardian to stay home with them, which meant some needed to resign from their job. Women were often expected to stay and care for their children and home, while also homeschooling their children and maintaining other duties. These mothers that stayed home weren’t paid a salary for all of the work they did, but before the pandemic, day care workers, teachers, and housekeepers were all paid for their job. Outsourcing this kind of domestic labor was no longer an option. 
	The article described an idea from a law professor at Fordham which discusses a “racial paradox” in which BPOC are “more likely to be unemployed due to the impacts of the pandemic on the labor market.” It also discusses that the “essential” workers are underpaid and overrepresented and they are forced to work with a greater risk of being exposed to COVID-19. According to a study by the C.D.C, women made up 72% of essential healthcare workers that were hospitalized during the peak of the virus, mentioned in Kisner’s article. With the gender pay gap being the widest it has been in a very long time, it is unfair that women in healthcare, even more specifically the Black and POC communities, were not getting compensated for their work as much as they should have been. 
	I never put too much thought into the effects many women faced during and after COVID-19. Part of that reason is because I was just a freshman and sophomore in high school and didn’t need my mother to stay home and watch me. I helped out a lot around the house, I did laundry and dishes and made food for my brother. Meanwhile, my mother was working in healthcare while doing online schooling for her Master’s degree. She was lucky enough to have a stable income and help around the house to keep things at bay, but it makes me wonder about all of the other mothers. The underprivileged, the minorities, the poor. This article made me think about single mothers and how they can barely provide for their children through their low paying jobs and the expenses of childcare. The idea that even now, many women come home from their full time job just to do what Frederici calls “the 2nd shift” of cleaning, cooking, housekeeping, and taking care of children and spouses. In the United States, and around the world, it is so important to advocate for and educate others about the topic of domestic labor and find a solution that can better the lives of at least half of the population.
