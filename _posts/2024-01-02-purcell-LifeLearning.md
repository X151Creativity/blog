In his essay, [The joys of being an absolute beginner – for life](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/07/the-joys-of-being-an-absolute-beginner-for-life) by Tom Vanderbilt, the author uses an anecdote from his own life to describe the benefits and possibilities of learning as an adult. Talking about his engagement with the board game chess and his daughter's love and engagement with it, Vanderbilt makes a convincing argument as to the joys and possibilities enabled by learning new skills, arts, and hobbies.

I, for one, find myself flirting with new hobbies all the time. These days, I am trying to get away from my dissertation (which is a mess, but coming along) and find myself interested in niche video game communities: speedrunning, randomizers, custom map making, and so on. I have a lot of trouble with a lot of these subhobbies, partly because I am no good and partly because I have no time to become good. Moreover, I worry that the time spent learning the requisite skills to become better at one of these outside interests may be wasted when, after one hundred hours of being terrible, I decide that I do not *actually* like to do one of these things.

My reticence comes, in part, from some personal baggage: I got my MFA in film production. When I started the program I thought that I would actually enjoy the process of making films. What I learned after three years, a few panic attacks, and more student debt than I'd like, is that the process of making films (and the people who made them) had turned me off from the creative ideal I had imagined when I started the program. While this lesson was worth while, and while I have leveraged that degree in some ways, I do not know if it was worth the time, money, energy, and emotion I had spent.

I am getting a bit off track, but I think it helps nuance and frame some of my thoughts about Vanderbilt's essay. I think his main argument can be summarized as, "I think adults should spend more time learning things, because it benefits us", which I agree with, but I don't think he engages with (or, really, has space to do so) some of the more structural problems undergirding his quest to learn for life.

I want to look to a comment, early in the essay. Vanderbilt write,
>When my daughter first began competing in school chess tournaments, I would often chat to other parents. Sometimes, I’d ask if they played chess themselves. Usually, the reply was an apologetic shrug and a smile. When I volunteered that I was learning to play, the tone was cheerily patronising: “Good luck with that!” I thought: “If this game is so good for kids, why are adults ignoring it?” Seeing someone playing Angry Birds, I wanted to tap them on the shoulder and say: “Why are you having your kids do chess while you do that? This is the game of kings! There are chess games recorded from the 15th century!”

My issue springs from two problems:
1. Vanderbilt assumes that the time spent on a less *important* game like *Angry Birds* is worth less than spent on Chess.
2. Vanderbilt assumes that these parents are not doing anything with the time they have, and have the energy, ability, and budget to invest in a new hobby.

I may be nit picking here. Vanderbilt's anecdote is pretty general, pointing to a kind of malaise that undergirds so much of our free time. Is watching *Grey's Anatomy* or playing *Super Mario Wonder* or listening to *Taylor Swift* a form of learning akin to learning a skill like chess, or knitting, or carpentry? No. But I would argue that there are different kinds of engagement with the things we do in the day. For example, my wife and I watch a lot of *Murder She Wrote*. It is a cozy murder mystery series that follows a lot of repetitive beats and formulas, but we also have watched enough of it to comment and think about its structure, making, and meaning. We make wild accusations as to the murderer, comment on strange acting/directing/set design choices, and discuss when it doesn't age as well as it should.

I bring this up because Vanderbilt ignores the biggest issue to adult learning: it's definitely partially about feeling awkward while learning, but it is also about *time, energy, and resources*. The reason why I have concerns about his off-handed comments about fellow parents is that I think it ignores the reality that parenting is difficult, and time consuming, and expensive. I don't want to judge anyone who is trying to better their kids, even if it means that the time spent supporting them is 'wasted'.

Circling back, then, there's a missing piece, which is: How exactly do we decide that we like a thing well enough to dive in? Vanderbilt and his daughter stumbled onto chess and found something they loved. I don't think we all can fall into our interests quite so easily, but I suspect that, as Vanderbilt argues late in the essay, "Skill learning seems to be *additive*; it’s not only about the skill." That is, learning to learn helps open doors: the first step is finding something that interests us, which can be difficult depending on how well one knows oneself, and the second is finding the time, energy, and wherewithal to commit to learning. 

The second one is the big gap to cross, but I suspect it is one that doesn't have to be bridged in a day, or a week, or a year, but for as long as anyone can spend time to stay interested in a pursuit.
