There are many different types of art and math. A surprising part of these is that they can connect to each other, as seen through "Knots," by Carol Strohecker. Her writing is about howknots can actually be meaningful, even when people are just tying their shoes.

Carol begins by discussing how she taught her younger brother to tie his shoes when they were younger. She developed a mantra about how to tie her shoes and taught it to her younger brother. Her younger brother persisted with this mantra and practiced knotting until he was successful. Even though her brother can't remember this event clearly, she remembers it enough for the both of them. This simple act of teaching her brother how to tie his shoes led to her finding a passion that she pursued for the rest of her life.

Many people think of knots as just a tangled mess. Carol thinks of knots as more than just a tangle of yarn or string. She finds beauty and math behind knots. She trned knots into a form of math in order to create beautiful works of art. She uses knots to make gifts for her friends and family. She made many things including "a ceramic vase with square knot decoration and braided handles, a clock with knots in places of numbers, two seared glass spindles entwined to form an elegant bracelet" (Strohecker), and more. She used something that could be seen as a mess or a simple task to do and turned it into something meaningful.

The most meaningful part of the knots that Strohecker teaches her students is to connect it to their lives. She tells the readers how there can be hidden connections between art and real life. One of her students, Jill, connected her knot project to her life through her creation of the "True Lovers' Knot." She created an interactive knot where people could pull in it as much as they wanted. At the end of the description of what to do with the knot is the phrase "Please pull me" (Strohecker). This is a reference to her home situation. She was the knot and her parents were the strings pulling her. Her parents were divorced and they didn't communicate very well. Her parents disagreed often and she probably feels like she is being pulled between the two. 

Strohecker also discusses that when making art out of knots, it can fall apart or get tangled. When they get tangled, people should restart and work their way through it again. This can be correlated to our lives. When things become complicated, it is always possible to figure it out, work through the problem, and continue on. When something in life all seems to be coming apart or unraveling, you can always start again. With persistence, it is always possible to get through issues and continue trying.

I think that Strohecker wants us to take this story and incorporate it into our own lives. I believe she wants us to know that something so simple could be turned into something complicated and meaningful. It is important to find these passions in our own lives. When Strohecker was observing the children as "they wrapped, rotated, flipped, twisted, and shifted scales as they ties" (Strohecker), she was observing the beauty of it. Instead of ignoring the things that could be perceived as simple, we should be looking for the beauty of it. We should be finding beauty in the twists of life just like she saw beauty in the twists of the knots. Even though sometimes knots can be chaotic, they can also be beautiful, just like life.
