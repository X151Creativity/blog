Few bullet points to start out-  

I feel that the main point of the article, "Against Interpretation" by Susan Sontag, is to not over look the important of what the artist has created.  

My understanding is that Sontag believes that many times the viewer of a piece of art over looks for the hidden mean instead of enjoying the beauty of the art.  

I can agree with this point of view, but I also do enjoy finding the hidden meaning of the artwork.  

To me, it can be view as equally important on finding the hidden meaning of an artwork and to just enjoy the artwork.  

From page 3, "Thus, interpretation is not (as most people assume) an absolute value, a gesture of mind situated in some timeless realm of capabil- ities."  

I feel that Sontag is trying to say that the interpretation is personal and could change a different point of a person's life.  

Overall, I could see if you agree or disagree with her point of view, because as you can read from my post, I have mixed opinions on the subject as well.   

Susan Sontag's "Against Interpretation" main point is to convince the audience to enjoy the beauty of things (artwork) instead of looking for the underlying meaning. You look at a picture or painting or artwork and think various of hour or even days on how or why the artwork was created. This idea of finding the hidden meaning of the artwork might take away from the beauty of the artwork is the main reason for writing this article. 

My main take away from this reading is my bullet point, “I feel that Sontag is trying to say that the interpretation is personal and could change a different point of a person's life.”  

Life experience(s) will greatly contribute to how someone can interpret anything in life. Someone that has been raised in a good home, with plenty of resources, is going to have different views than someone who was raised in a poverty household. At the same token, however, they might have similar points of view compared to someone who has been raised in a very wealthy family. Another example of how life experiences affect an individual's interpretation of something is if the person has had to work for things in life or the person has just been given things in life. This can be seen in athletics for example. If someone is naturally athletic, then they might be able to get by on pure athletic ability. However, a naturally gifted athlete must work harder to catch up to them. Because of this extra work, sometimes the less gifted will pass the gifted because they have created a great work ethic.  


Culture- Culture can greatly impact someone’s interpretation. It is easy to say that a man in the 1700s and one in the 1800s and one in the 1900s and one in the 2000s would all have different points of view on everyday life. This point, however, leads right back to my first point of life experiences. The man that lived in the 1700s most likely would have not had access to electricity. The man in the 1800s would have lived during the Civil War. The man in the 1900s would have been able to drive one of the first cars. The man in the 2000s would be able to watch Tik Tok on his smart phone. It is amazing to see how different life changes from one era to the next.  

Relationships- Relationships also play a huge role in how and what you believe in and how someone interprets various aspects of life. I have heard this phrase from a preacher, and it has stuck with me for a long time and is extremely true. “You are the average of the five people you are around the most,” Archie Ellett said one Sunday at church. I don’t know if this was his quote, but that is not the point. The point is, the people you are around the most are the people who are going to influence you the most, which will impact the way you will view anything in life. This point can and will also lead back to the main point of how life experience greatly impacts how anyone views the world, but I feel that relationships add to that point even more as well because it also values the experiences of others, not just yourself.  

Health/Age- Health and age are my final point of factors that can make someone interpret something a certain way. It is easy to say that someone who is 10 and someone that is 50 will have different values and beliefs. The 10-year-old most likely will be focused on being a kid, while the 50-year-old will be focused on larger aspects of life like family, work, relationship with God, and other things of value. This is important to remember because it could and will impact the way someone views life.
