After reading, the week 4 New York Times Article, The Lockdown Showed How the Economy Exploits Women. She Already Knew; I was able to uncover many new concepts.

First being, a general overview of what I learned. Before the pandemic, women were getting exploited, they were getting paid less per hour than men. Around Feb 2021, when this article was written, women were still being exploited for their work. Once the pandemic was over and companies had suffered tremendous losses, they had one option and one option only, to cut jobs to ensure that less money was lost for the company. Statistically speaking, I was able to pull a stat from Forbes, stating that women get paid 82 cents per each $1 made by men. This is a large loss for not just women but also households who rely on single income to survive. In a time where groceries, gas and other necessities for life are at an all time high, it's not fair. Not only women lost their jobs, many men did too. The workforce wasn't looking for jobs that women held and let them go since they were probably getting paid less. The companies had to do in depth analysis and decide which jobs could be automated by AI and which couldn't, those jobs that could be replaced, were. Since we were still in a pandemic in Feb 2021, that meant that schools and daycares were being shut down due to health concerns. If both parents were working then who was incharge of taking care of the child? Even when both parents are working at home, it can still be mentally and physically taxing to have to work and take care of a kid. Typically, since women have been tasked with “women ‘s work”. . For a single income parent this is not a way to live as you can't provide an adaptive environment for your child to grow up in.

Just to think, not only were white collar workers harmed in the pandemic by losing their jobs, but also by losing out on pay; but blue collar workers, independent contractors and many others were harmed as well. For Blue collar workers, their hourly wages decreased due to the lack of work needed. As for independent contractors, they are able to charge however much they feel is necessary for their services. For many people during the pandemic people didn’t have money to spend on house cleaning or other independent contracted services, causing this group of people to lose out. 


Throughout the article Federici, pleas with her readers as she realizes the undervalued life that she has lived. She writes that in December of 2021, Women lost 156,000 jobs while men gained 16,000 jobs. Now to wonder what this is from is a wild guess, but it can be somewhat narrowed down to the fact that companies are losing money and need to start by cutting out the people who they pay the least, the women. Throughout 2021, nearly 2.3 Million American women dropped out of the workforce, this is because they had other “women’s work” tasks to complete like caring for their child. 

To answer one of the questions which were posted 
Is there something that relates to your own life experience?

Yes, not to the extreme that Federici experienced, but similar. When I was 16 years old I applied for my first job at my local Chipotle in California. Because of my age and availability, the shift manager was hesitant to hire me. I was only available to work Friday, Saturday and Sunday, as I went to high school about 1 hour away from this Chipotle location. 

Fortunately, I was able to pick up a job at the Alameda County Fairgrounds, in Event Coordination. This was one of the few places that “trusted” my working abilities. Now I am currently working with the Fairgrounds and in 2021 I was promoted to Assistant Event Coordinator. This meant that at the age of 18 I was incharge of a team of 30 people who were senior to me (40-50 years of age). This was a huge accomplishment for me and I am forever grateful for this opportunity. This goes to show that no matter how many times you are knocked down and told “no” to stand up and use that as motivation to do better. Now I am making more, have learned much more and am better prepared for life as this job has taught me the critical skill of being detail oriented.
