excerpt:   "Open Wounds"
author: wade-hall
pullquote:  "Upon the death of the other we are given to memory, and thus to interioriza-
tion, since the other, outside us, is now nothing. And with the dark light of this
nothing, we learn that the other resists the closure of our interiorizing mem-
ory. With the nothing of this irrevocable absence, the other appears as other,
and as other for us, upon his death or at least in the anticipated possibility of
a death, since death constitutes and makes manifest the limits of a me or an us
who are obliged to harbor something that is greater and other than them;
something outside them within them."

Main points of Open Wounds 
Experience- The human experience is extremely important in various aspect of life, and it the experience of one person can define how they behave, act, and react to various aspects of life. In this case, the author highlights the experience of a minority (LGBTQ and a  Japanese American) during War War two. She is able to do this through various forms of art and film. The author uses these techniques to highlight and represent the oppressed during this rough time in modern human history. It is important to remember that just in the past 250 year, Africans, Jewish people, Asian people, Indian people, and many other groups that I didn't mention have be either discriminated against, oppressed, killed, judged, or were misrepresented. However, though because of these difficult times, I feel that it is sparking a change in the minds of others, so that all people can be treated equally and there can be a sense of respect for almost all groups and beliefs, with the exception of pure evil. 
Identity- In today's society, identity is a very heated topic that is heard about every day. I feel that it is extremely important for a person to share their beliefs and for all people to be able to learn from one another, along with teaching one another. We all can have a voice, and I feel that is what the author was fighting for back in the time of World War two, the right to have a voice. All people have the right to speak the truth and factual evidence, along with opinions to support the truth.
Resilience- The author also explains resilience in "Open Wounds". This can be shown by explaining how people who were oppressed in the 1900s were able to overcome, and even in some cases become better people because of the trials and tribulations that they had to face. By no means am I saying that oppression is a good thing, but this can be a great test of mental strength for a person. Someone that is able to overcome the odds in a terrible situation, like oppression, is able to do almost anything.
Memory- I feel that the final point the other is trying to make is to remember history. We cannot forget times of when groups of people were treated in horrible way, and as growing people of the future, we must work to advocate for people groups that are wrongly mistreat by defending them. I am a very faithful person, so it is important for me the follow the Golden rule, which is to Treat others how you would want to be treated. I think that if we are able to teach the future generations this very powerful principle, then we will be much better of as a society. 
Pullquote highlights- Everyone is affect by the boundary of death. Regardless of who you are, everyone has a time to live and a time to die, so it is important that you make the most of everything you do. I heard a wise man one time say that life is similar to a game of chest, every move counts. It is important that you make the best move you can on the chest board, as many times as you can. For example, give that 10$ to charity, but at the same token, if you gave it with your left hand, don't let your right hand know that you gave the 10$. This means that is means more for a person to give out of the kindness of their heart rather than to get joy from people telling you that you are a good person. I beleive that God will reward the humble giver because they have choosen to give out of the kindness of their heart rather than to give for the credit of others.
