title: Feedback on "Knots"
excerpt:

One of the problems with unpacking the possibilities of play, especially in a creative field, is that a lot of the scholarship on the activities of play come out of psychology. We read D. W. Winnicott's *Playing and Reality* to point to this history, but there is also Johan Huizinga's *Homo Ludens* which borrows from evolutionary models to describe the centrality of play in human culture.

This discourse is known as ludology, and is most interested in the ways games are played, how gameplay acts out in our minds, and argues why games are so important culturally. (Useful here is to note that ludology is at odds with another end of the game studies discourse known as narratology, which sees games as cultural artifacts which can and should be read for ideological, political, and historical value.) The field of game studies emerged in these discourses because prior to the codification of a literature around games in the late twentieth century, games were not seen as an object of value for research, and play was seen as a less important phenomenon.

I narrate this history to stress the strangest aspect of Carol Stroehecker's essay: why are knots important? In many ways they are not, but the author sees value in them for various reasons. This is why she ran the, now defunct, MIT Knot Lab. (She now works at the University of Minnesota in a leadership role in that school's College of Design.) In his blog post, Jackson summarizes Stroehecker's history with knots:

>The author speaks a lot about the importance of recognizing and seeing that knots are not, no pun intended, just insignificant things. They are not just loops in a piece of rope, they are quite significant actually, and she emphasizes throughout the entire work, how symbolic and interesting they are to her. She speaks a lot about the educational value of knots for children, and the essay emphasizes and ensures that we understand that knots are not just knots. Still, it allows children to explore the mathematical concepts present in a playful and creative way. Making knots allows children to think about and consider combination, separation, and lots of other concepts that on the surface we wouldn’t even consider.

Jackson was less convinced as to whether this is actually true, and a degree of skepticism is warranted. Stroehecker is a knot apologist, after all, and a lot of her career is indebted to her work with knots. All we have is her word for whether it is right, because this essay forgoes the sticky problems of scientific proof.

Jose gives a helpful framework to think about Stroehecker's essay in a looser way. He articulates in his blog post an idea that the knot is a kind of placeholder: something physical to let the play happen through. Jose writes,

>The knot is creativity [formed] into an object. Doing something creative helps our mental health. Specifically, doing the creativity part helps to let go of the stress or something negative. Afterward, playing with creativity can be fun because of the action towards creativity. [^1]

The knot is not the center of the argument, but the object from which Stroehecker is able to make a more concrete claim: play works better with something physical, something real, something tangible. There may be additional mathematical reasons why knots are important, but that especially in the case of Jill's life experience the knot was an intermediary upon which Jill's problems and traumas got projected onto. Amir's blog post articulates as much,

>Jill mentioned to Carol that her parents got divorced and that she was in a split custody relationship with her parents. She keeps mentioning the True lover knot, which to me can be used as a symbol, to show that there may be tension in a relationship, but together they can come together to surpass the tension and hopefully come back together.

The knot becomes a placeholder to express and explore tensions within Jill's life. The act of play helps Jill process external traumas related to her parent's divorce, and the True Lover knot makes that tangible. The importance is less on the knot itself—-it could be anything (like the toys which Winnicott describes in his book)--but the act of play helped process and reflect.
