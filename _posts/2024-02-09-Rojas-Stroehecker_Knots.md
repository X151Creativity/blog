Knot is essay writing that provides an understanding of playing creativity through knots. Not only talking about knots but a helpful therapy through creativity. In the author's writing, he passionately explains why knots or other forms of creativity are therapy for the user. First of all, she was inspired to create a program by helping her brother tie his shoes. Afterward, the program that she creates. Help many kids to knot but also be creative. From the proof, she witnesses many significant benefits and improvements throughout the program. In addition, interacts with students that significantly great creativity knots. Carol understands the ongoing problem that the student has and discovers a new understanding within her knot program.   

Carol's thesis tells us that creativity is therapy within the person. In a way, she is giving a message to us that creativity is a helpful way to deal with life problems. Likewise, he shared his own experiences and witnessed from his method. Especially, she shared her perspective on doing her knots. Eventually, Carol enjoyed the experience when she tied her brother's shoes. Another piece of evidence to provide the thesis is when she developed a program that teaches knotting. Then she reflects until the end, seeing different children having their learning style and their creativity. Finally, she concludes that forms of creativity like painting, drawing, or objects help to produce their expression and therapy within life problems.  

Finding creative forms which help to explore and express that essay is just to say. Playing with creativity produces therapy and improvement with the user. From the thesis, or from reading it, Carol suggests is particularly important is find creativity in object form. To explore it and express it freely from the problems. From my analysis, she shared her own experiences and perspectives to be connected to her thesis and why it’s so important. After all, she promptly does creativity as therapy for the mind. Throughout the essay, Carol argues that playing with creativity is important. Where people can express their feelings and are able to communicate through media or society.  


I notice the author is telling a message. Throughout his own experience, thoughts, and witness through knotting. Creativity is therapy for people or artists from real-world problems. For example, “Knot making showed me how commonplace objects can help people think of purpose fully about continuity and separation, combination, and deviation. Through knots, I learned that engaging objects can help people to build intuitions about mathematics. And witnessing one of the female participants succumb to stereotypical math phobia after such a strong start as a fifth grader spurred my determination to encourage the representation of different learning styles in all pedagogy.” (p.3) Carol connects me very well with her theme from her response. In addition, creativity can help people with issues and along with feeling stress-free from society.  

Overall, the essay is very inspiring to read and understand in creativity. I reason that Carol opens a new perspective on creativity. Where doing something creative helps to let the pain or feel rejoice throughout the experience. Inspiring to teach others about creativity and doing something creative in our free time.  

I agree with the author's point of view that creativity is helpful. In like manner, I agree with her that the idea of doing something creative helps a person to be stress-free or enjoyment that turns into a hobby. From her point of view doing knot. She understands the potential that knots help bring connection. Likewise, she mentions “Knot-making showed me how  

commonplace objects can help people think purpose fully about continuity and separation, combination and  

deviation”(p.5) about doing knots. Moreover, it connects very into other pieces of creativity. Where people create art pieces about how they feel or express themselves toward the world. Also, audiences may have interpreted it in their mind. After all, I agree with her, and she inspired me to have something to do with creativity. Eventually, bringing closer to my community and feeling enjoyment within my artwork.  

After a moment of reading, I can understand Carol's essay in his words “Through the course of the project, Jill expressed her emotions in knots and tried to initiate some emotional repairs as well: frustrated with being pulled by others led her to devise a step-by-step approach to knot tying.”(p.4) The knot is creativity from into an object. Doing something creative helps our mental health. Specifically, doing the creativity part helps to let go of the stress or something negative. Afterward, playing with creativity can be fun because of the action towards creativity.  

Within the reading, it relates to me very well. Doing my first drawing or some form of creativity helps me to express my feelings and thoughts. Afterward, I felt alive and stress-free from when I was a kid. And the author is sharing her own experience and lesson with the essay. Surely, I would like to share that experience and moment. In general, we have higher expectations of perfectionism towards creativity. Instead, we should enjoy the process without judgment and have fun. After all, It relates to my own experience in playing creatively.  

One thing I felt confused about was the beginning of the article of quote in The Savage Mind. I asked myself, “What is the purpose of putting it there?” Or “Is this relevant to the reading?” I guess she helps us preparing for reading the essay and understanding the theme.
