Our guest blogger, Anthony Guest-Scott, wrote [a succinct summary post](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/01/13/Guest-Scott-Kohn.html) about Alfie Kohn's essay "[The case against grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/)." I am especially thankful for his external citations, working through the criticism of others who have applied "ungrading" (and "degrading") to their coursework. I wanted to give some extra context, because Anthony was limited by the brief word count. I also wanted to take Anthony's writing as a way for us to think about how *structural* problems can be solved. (If that is even possible.)

I want to analyze this term, *structural*, a bit. It is important for Anthony's summary of Kohn's argument:

>He’s making a compelling case against grades as an *unquestioned structural feature* of our education system. Not only because grades don’t seem to accomplish what we think they do, Kohn contends, but, even worse, they tend to produce the opposite of what it seems nearly every teacher, parent, and community member would want from our schools and the education of people in shared society.[^1]

So what does structural mean, and how is it used by academics to argue for social change? As I understand it, the term "structural" points to the ways systems create and enforce kinds of specific actions made by people who live in those systems. A structural problem is one in which everyone could be acting in the best interest of the community, school, city, or country, and it still results in a kind of harm for the whole community or for a subset of those within it.

Structural thinking ends up being really helpful for scholars interested in race. I'll take an example from my own research to illustrate this. There's a fantastic book by Harriet Washington titled *Medical Apartheid*; in it Washington looks at the racial disparities in health, and thinks about how those are the result of hundreds of years of overt and covert racism. It isn't that doctors exploited Black bodies for centuries (although they did[^2]), so much as the entire system views non-white people differently. Washington writes,

>The much bewailed racial health gap is not a gap, but a chasm wider and deeper than a mass grave. This gulf has riven our nation so dramatically that it appears as if we were consdiering the health profiles of people in two different countries—a medical apartheid.”[^3]

 The problem is sometimes implicit, [resulting in different care practices based on racist beliefs](https://www.improvediagnosis.org/dxiq-column/why-the-color-of-your-skin-can-affect-the-quality-of-your-diagnosis/#:~:text=Almost%2090%20percent%20of%20the,though%2C%20the%20opposite%20is%20true.), and sometimes explicit, especially considering the [exceptionally high mortality rate for Black women in childbirth](https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/from-birth-to-death/black-women-maternal-mortality-rate.html). The result, no matter the cause, is the continued harm for a huge percentage of the U.S. population.
 
 Returning to Anthony's argument, Kohn's structural critique of education is levied at the grade as an evaluative method. So, according to Kohn, emphasizing the grade shifts how everything else is taught: from lectures, to tests, to assignments, *the grade determines how these activities are proctored, framed, and understood.* Looking to some of the critiques, which Anthony cites, I see two themes:
 
 1. There is a problem regarding implementation. How are teachers supposed to ungrade in graded situations. (We have to navigate this problem at IU, because at the end of the day everyone *has* to get a grade.)
 2. No matter the goals of an educator, they are a single actor in a deeply unequal world.
 
 I do not think there is an easy answer to these problems. We are, often, too small to effect change at scale.[^4] Our interventions, no matter our intent, are caught in a riptide of our own assumptions, and our culture's currents. My question for Anthony, to reflect on in the next weeks, is: What can we (educators, or students) do to address these systemic, structural problems? Is there anything?
