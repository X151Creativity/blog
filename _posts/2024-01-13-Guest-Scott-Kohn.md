The basic argument, the thesis of Kohn’s piece, [The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/), is right in the title:  He’s making a compelling case against grades as an unquestioned structural feature of our education system.  Not only because grades don’t seem to accomplish what we think they do, Kohn contends, but, even worse, they tend to produce the opposite of what it seems nearly every teacher, parent, and community member would want from our schools and the education of people in shared society.  

People usually say we grade to measure learning and motivate.  The problem, Kohn argues, is that decades of research undercut these assumptions, in 3 main, interrelated ways.  Grades…

1.	Don’t motivate except as extrinsic (external) motivators and coerced behavior.  And the more you focus on extrinsic motivators, the less intrinsic motivation (the kind that comes from inside of you, based on a genuine desire to learn) tends to remain.
2.	Tend to diminish students’ interest in whatever they’re learning and create a preference for the easiest possible task, negatively impacting their willingness to take risks and stretch their capabilities (in other words, you’re better off doing the more comfortable, safe thing to get the best grade – the message students are getting about what “success” looks like – than learning). 
3.	Reduce the quality of students thinking, as they seek to narrow what they’re looking for to “what they’ll need to know for the test.”  

To just look at a child’s educational performance as forward or backward movement along a number line is not only overly simplistic and reductive; it compromises our ability to think in more complex ways about assessment.  

I am deeply sympathetic to Kohn’s views, the research he cites, and what I think of as a more inspiring and ambitious model for education at all levels.  It’s well-supported with adjacent research I am already familiar with as someone working in higher education to help college students to improve their learning and academic performance.  For example, robust research across a number of fields shows that [good grades and powerful learning do not necessarily go together](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Learning-Versus-Performance-Soderstrom-Bjork/b7851173cfa643956fc52e40c79655526af8c5b8?p2df).  This means it may be possible to earn good grades in a class by simply following instructions and completing tasks – compliance and imitation of what one thinks the instructor wants - without the substance of really understanding the material more deeply or why it matters.  Thus, if nothing about one’s thinking changed or really improved, despite receiving a good grade, can we really call that “learning” in any meaningful sense?  Conversely, one can learn an enormous amount – in some cases the most - from an assignment which they received a lower grade.

[Susan Blum and others have expanded upon Kohn’s arguments here and advocated for a form of alternative assessment called, most recently, “ungrading”](https://www.chronicle.com/article/grades-can-hinder-learning-what-should-professors-use-instead/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_1064488&cid=nwsltrtn&source=ams&sourceId=4948426&cid2=gen_login_refresh&sra=true) (Kohn refers to a similar approach as “degrading”), and it’s been making the rounds of late in higher education circles.  Such practices do not necessarily dispense with grades (many of us at various institutions are made to submit grades of some kind for our classes), but rather experiment with a variety of growth-oriented, reflective, and student-collaborative methods for arriving at the final grade course grade.  (Note: There are a wide variety of approaches to the umbrella that is being called “ungrading,” and there are many others under different names that attempt to prioritize growth and learning over performance; others may include specifications [“specs”] grading, labor-based grading, etc.  For a good lexicon of what’s out there at the moment, take a look here at the [“An Alternative Grading Glossary”](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/an-alternative-grading-glossary) post on David Clark’s and Robert Talbert’s [Grading for Growth Substack](https://gradingforgrowth.com)).

And yet, I’ve encountered some additional perspectives in response to ungrading and some of its foundations that express important concerns I take seriously and need to think more about.  One point of view was expressed recently in a guest post by Jayme Dyer on the Grading for Growth Substack entitled [“Ungrading Has An Equity-Related Achilles Heel,”](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/ungrading-has-an-equity-related-achilles#:~:text=But%2C%20ungrading%20has%20an%20equity,sometimes%20the%20student's%20%2D%20implicit%20biases.) which Dyer identifies as a heightened propensity to exacerbate implicit biases (Dyer notes she has taught a number of ungraded courses, but doesn’t plan to do so again for that reason).  And I very much share some of the uneasiness explained by Emily Pitts Donahoe in a post ([“Final Grades: An Airing of Grievances”](https://emilypittsdonahoe.substack.com/p/final-grades-an-airing-of-grievances)) on her [Substack, Unmaking the Grade](https://emilypittsdonahoe.substack.com).  Donahoe points out the reductiveness (and even hypocrisy) of assigning those final grades after all this semester-long conversation about growth, along with its subjective, guessing-game quality (from the students’ perspective who are trying to assess their own performance), among other concerns.  Finally, I can see some important uses of more extrinsic motivators in the classroom space outlined by James M. Lang and Kristi Rudenga in [their recent piece in the Chronicle](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-embrace-the-power-of-extrinsic-motivation-in-class#:~:text=Use%20the%20first%20few%20minutes,have%20a%20thoughtful%2C%20meaningful%20discussion.), in which they use them to help students through such means as required office hour visits to build relationships, incentives to do reading assignments and participate in class to foster richer engagement, and points to help students prioritize the important learning they are trying to foster.  

I have more thinking to do on this, but here’s where it stands at the time I am writing this:  I love what ungrading offers at the broadest levels, but I am eager to experiment with more refined implementations of it in my own career that 1) make room for the selective and strategic use of growth-directed extrinsic motivators; 2) offer students more specific support in evaluating their own learning; and 3) remaining vigilant about finding ways to keep some checks on implicit biases to the extent this is ever possible.  Not sure yet how I’ll do this, but that’s OK – I’m not doing this for a grade, awards, or accolades; I’m doing this to learn and improve the learning of others in my care!  In other words, I’m “ungrading” myself.
