“The Nested Precarities of Creative Labor on Social Media”, compiled by Brooke Erin Duffy, Annika Pinch, Shruti Sannon, and Megan Sawey is an interesting journal article, covering intricate details about the challenges associated with creative labor within the dynamic framework of social media platforms. They introduce the concept of “nested precarities” to encapsulate the layered vulnerabilities and uncertainties, that content creators go through, in the pursuit of creative expression on the digital platform. 

The authors convey a range of themes around “nested precarities”, that constitute themes like economic uncertainty, platform uncertainty, lack of job security, and the term “visibility” in the context of social media presence. The article also deals with the dynamics of relying on social media platforms as a primary source of income, highlighting the susceptibility of creators to algorithmic changes, which tend to be opaque at times and significantly impact content creation, their social media presence, and their overall approach and attitude towards their work and the platform.

The authors consider this a crucial subject matter, because it concerns and influencers' work, dependability on public validation based on their content, the essence of being recognized in terms of getting views and likes, which to a certain extent, is a superficial way of being personally validated, and causes a multifaceted impact on mental health, considering the strain of maintaining a positive and likeable online image, coping up with criticism, and dealing with the overall rollercoaster of ups and downs of social media platforms and their algorithms.

The article discusses "visibility’ as a requirement for success in this industry, along with changes in platforms to express creative content, the constitution of sponsorships, collaborations, and partnerships to enhance presents. They also talk about algorithmic systems, which are dynamic, and their impact constantly fluctuates and evolves. This requires influencers to be adaptable to their brand subject activities and practices across various platforms. Though most interviewees concentrated their time, energy, and efforts on a single platform but always found it necessary to maintain a presence on a wider range of social media platforms. Some interviewees found “engagement”, while others gave more importance to “followers” and “likes”, as factors to judge social media success and gain further access to exclusive platform features to enhance their career as a “social media influencer” or “content creator”.   

The author introduces the term “shadow-banned”, elaborating on the lines of visibility and algorithms. Shadow banning implies an algorithm change, which somehow almost blocks a user’s account, thereby impacting their reach, and reducing their engagement and visibility. This leads to frustration and feeling of not being recognized or seen. At times, a user is not notified of being shadow banned, which leads to ambiguity and the loss of confidence and self-belief, to some extent. Similar uncertain changes in platform features, transparent or opaque, require creators to continually adapt, and be ready to switch and shift their engagement to other social media platforms.

The author's perspective and the experiences of all the interviewees, reveal how people are mentally exhausted and hampered by unpredictability. Visibility, being a key factor of such instability, boosts creators' confidence, under the guise of likes, views, and shares, but always renders the threat of having to be invisible, someday and suddenly, leading to a sense of “job insecurity”. Though not in much depth and significance, some interviewers also mention social inequalities and marginalization as a concern on digital platforms. 

Overall, the article calls for a nuanced understanding of the precarity of creative labour on social media, where the authors advocate for research and understanding to mitigate the challenges faced by content creators, recognizing the need for strategies to account for the economic, social, and emotional dimensions of their work life in the digital space.

I believe the thesis of this article because I understand that social media, not just for content creators, but for every other individual, becomes a stressful space in terms of presence, visibility, and validation from people, which at times one barely even knows. I believe in the authors' opinion regarding instability and uncertainty in different dimensions including emotional, financial, and mental ones. 

The idea that “visibility” and “social presence” become factors that influence one’s mental peace resonates with me. In certain situations, people start prioritizing social media to an extent when it becomes an addiction for them to talk about it, think over it, and have a conversation only about people’s opinions regarding them on social media. Drifting from creative labor for a moment, individuals become overly invested in the superficial world of social media, when their only interest starts to lie in others’ lives or how glamorous or not glamourous their own life appears to be. 

For a content creator, social media presence is their livelihood, and they work with their utmost potential and effort to be good at their work, but I believe that work-life balance is given utmost importance in every other career, and thus even influencers must try and maintain it in their life. Having to maintain a certain engagement and number of followers is justified, for one pursuing this as their profession, but ensuring that it doesn’t begin to hamper one’s emotional, financial, and mental story is a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy ecosystem and a fulfilling, satiable, and happy personal life.
