I want to start this blog post with a quick run down of how the history of the slave trade connects to the creation of AI images. It is a bit of a loose connection.[^1] The way this argument goes is that a series of interrelated practices incentivize the dehumanization of certain peoples, and through those practices enable a more efficient means of practicing business. Jessica Marie Johnson, in her essay "Markup Bodies" describes how the transformation of human beings into sellable objects also meant that they could be transformed into data points. What shipping manifests do is track the number of human beings being trafficked on slave ships into a quantifiable number.[^2] How many people were moved from Africa to the Americas results in a number--a discrete object--as opposed to *who was taken from their home and who was killed in the process*. The nuance between the humanity of a subject--a humanity which is implied by a series of rights, a history, a culture--and the inhumanity of a number gives way to the abstraction of that humanity: a data point is separate from the lived subject.

The insurance industry is an example of how transforming human beings into numerical values is both dehumanizing and very profitable. A health insurance company operates by valuing potential risk against potential profits: so, it says an average client will incur a certain amount of health expenditures, which the health insurance company will cover for a certain fee. The idea is that, on average, the beneficiary of the health insurance program will expend less overall than the amount of money they put in; the value that they gain from being in the insurance program is that, should the worst case happen, and they experience an expensive health crisis then they would be covered by the insurance. The data driven aspect of this industry comes from how to best predict whether potential clients will pay into the health insurance company more than the health insurance company would pay back to them. If an insurance company can predict that a person would suffer a heart attack sooner than another person (tied for example to them being a smoker, or being obese), then the health insurance company may argue that it would need those people to pay more in premiums.[^3]

This is all a preamble to show how statistics produce *value*. Being able to predict an outcome means being able to take advantage of it, to capitalize upon it. The problem is that while a population of smokers, or people with high blood pressure, or people born in a certain ZIP code may be more susceptible to certain maladies, by erasing their humanity through the flattening of their identities to quantification, it denies their individuality, their right to live, and their history. It makes it easier to deny service because a person has a 'preexisting condition', or because they cannot pay an exorbitant premium. To predict, using statistical methods, requires the flattening of a mass of subjects to data points.

With this in mind, Jackson's blog post illustrates a second ethical problem at the heart of these practices: that gambling on others presents a precarious relationship between the industry and their stakeholders. Jackson writes,

>The people who originated this predictive analysis and threw the butterfly effect allowed gambling on sports to be created, have directly contributed to people, losing generations of money, and their life savings, and have ruined many lives. Aside from the slave trade, which is obviously really, really bad, the lives of millions of people worldwide have been altered just because of the select people who were present in the creation of this betting and wagering taking place in this coffee shop.

The problem which Jackson is alluding to is that these kinds of gambling happens in all sorts of ways, from the gambling practiced by sports aficionados, to the market predictions by bankers and stock traders, to the calculations on acceptable casualties in war.
