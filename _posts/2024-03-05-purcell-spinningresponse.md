We read Tillie Walden's graphic novel *Spinning* to try to get a sense of the strange knot of expectation, creative activity, and precarity which can manifest in burn out. Tillie's experience as a queer teen in Austin, Texas; as a competitive skater; as a girl who was bullied and alienated; works through the melancholy and exhaustion which being a young person can feel like. The graphic novel gives space and time to understanding this feeling, and roots the change and growth in Tillie in her finding a voice, both figuratively (through her artistic illustrations) and literally (as she comes out, as she confronts her mom about quitting ice skating).

Rio, in his blog post, noted this specific change:

> Tillie seemed to be numb in a sense where she was so done with everything and couldn’t even help or know what to feel. I know what that exact feeling is like and what It comes from. But as I’ve gotten a way better understanding of Tilli’s feelings it allowed me to also realize why I was feeling like I had failed back then. I think it’s because I wasn’t accepting who I was, and I couldn’t find myself. But just as Tillie did, I was able to engage with multiple activities that started to motivate me more and strengthen my mental health.

The theme of voicelessness and finding one's voice is a valuable one. Being able to speak with confidence as to your needs, be they a need for rest, shelter, support, can be a challenging one, because so much of our lives are tied to being helpful to others (but not to ourselves).

Elizabeth, in her blog post, notes that there is a specific kind of queer tension between Tillie and the demands of figure skating, one which Tillie both embraces and distances herself from. The danger come from the toxic sexualization of the sport--with its hidden rules and overt pageantry--which is so normalized. Elizabeth writes,

> This message that has been ingrained in Tillie through her skating is likely why she responds to unwanted male attention the way she does throughout the book. When her SAT tutor assaults her, she fights enough so that he stops, and then continues on as if it didn’t happen. She has learned from skating that she is to be perceived sexually, and since she wore a tank top to tutoring, it is inevitable that she was assaulted.

Elizabeth's points to an ideological problem. (Ideology meaning an ingrained set of values which the overarching culture perceives as true.) Tillie blames herself for the sexual violence done to her, not the perpetrator of that violence. She pushes it down and does not speak about it because of all of those other moments where her voice was silenced: when she was being bullied; when she was sexualized while skating; when she was forced to hide her sexuality.

In John's blog post, he writes about Tillie sticking through with the sport:

>As I was reading the book, I couldn't help but have the theme of resilience constantly keep coming up in my head as well. As Walden stuck to figure skating in spite of all the odds, her journey became an exemplary showcase of the strength of one's mind if they don't give up. It was because of this the story was written really focusing on the list of the triumphs and failures, each contributing to the gradual growth and self-discovement of the narrator. Still, the resilience, visualized and verbalized became very real and soul-touching to me, reminding me of the fact that challenge belongs to the human experience.

I wonder, though, is if resilience is the right term. (And this may be coming from someone whose high school years were defined by emotional precarity) There is a sense of obligation for Tillie: to continue to maintain a status quo even while the world is falling apart around her. If it is resilience, it is a necessary one, not built out of strength of character, but by the impossibility to do anything else.

As I finish this response, I want to reflect on the care givers who surround Tillie. The ones, like her father or coach or cello teacher, who protect her; the ones who wish to support her, like her middle school principal who tried to give voice to her bullying; the ones who abused her, from her SAT tutor to her first figure skating coach. Where does resilience come from? Is it a thing we should romanticize, when instead we could think of Tillie's experience as something that is the result of a myriad toxic practices which are so everyday in our lives. How can we see Tillie's experience to help care for the burnout of our friends, colleagues, and families?
