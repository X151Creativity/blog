title: Feedback on "The Millennial Starving Artist"

One of the main themes of this class has been a concept we've been calling *creative labor*--the mundane, rote, and repetitive work that goes into the creation of a creative work. One of the limitations of the representation of creativity in popular culture is the idea that it is an easy inspiration driven process. It is something that comes to us through some secret wellspring, that if we tap it, we undoubtedly will be successful. The reality is that creative fields require work, and that work is generally uncompensated or poorly compensated.

The Take's video, [Kiki's Delivery Service: The Millennial Starving Artist](Kiki's Delivery Service: The Millennial Starving Artist), describes how Hayao Miyazaki's 1989 film makes literal the troubles experienced by creative workers. Anna, in her blog post, describes the metaphor well, writing,

>Magic becomes a stand-in for creativity. This is seen through Kiki excelling at a particular magical skill, her flying, which can be seen as an art form. Furthermore, Kiki’s Delivery Service insinuates that there are other kinds of magic when Kiki meets another witch on her way to the city who specializes in fortune telling. This other type of magic can be a metaphor for another type of art form from Kiki’s, much like dance and music, or writing and visual art. This allegory is important because Kiki’s struggles to find a way to enjoy her passion, flying, while monetizing it and not becoming burned out can help or inspire creative individuals who are looking to make their creative passions their career, and can also help those individuals if they do encounter or experience burnout themselves. 

There is a central theme in the movie: between the old, folktale driven world of magic personified by Kiki and her mom, and the new, modern world personified by Tombo and his flying club.[^1] The modern, with its urbanization, its new technologies, and its disconnection from the traditional, brings with it an alienation for Kiki (and for all of the people who live within it). Creativity, in both Kiki's flying and Ursula's painting, serves as a potential cure.

What Kiki's story gives is a series of tools to combat burnout--brought as it is by the alienation of the modern world, and the stress to commoditize the self. Isabella writes in her blog post, 

>I found it interesting in the video it’s mentioned that 10% of arts degrees are used for art. Due to not finding a career in their degree. Just so they can do more skills and how to do what a person loves. In society it’s pushed to work and not do what you love so you can just be a worker.  Kiki’s burnout is when she hits depression. Her burnout causes her not to fly. A solution was she needs to take a break from her skill so that way it’s not stuck and lose her passion. She’s able to find her passion again when she sees [Tombo].

Burnout and depression go hand in hand for Kiki, and the cure for this is decidedly unmodern: to go into the forest, to not commodify her time and creativity, to rest. Anna writes,

>If artists and those who wish to work creatively, whether through traditional arts careers like music, dance or writing, or through fields that are less commonly thought of as being traditionally creative, such as cooking, wish to overcome creative block, the advice to stop and allow oneself to rest and percolate new ideas may be better than simply forcing oneself to work harder. If constantly being forced to work when already feeling burnt out, the burnout and creative block may worsen, much like how Kiki entirely lost her magical abilities, including flying, after she was already feeling exhausted from running her flying delivery service. 

This is a weird, impossible ask: that taking time away now will benefit you in the future. It is counterproductive in relation to the kinds of activities we're all asked to do--to self promote, to make ourselves into the brand, to monetize our freetime. Sometimes rest (such a lazy, unmodern thing) is the best way to find ourselves.

[^1]: It is worth noting that Miyazaki's fanciful world appears to be a mid-century, European utopia (one which was not touched by the horrors of either world war). There is a strange subtext in the director's work that circumvents the fascist histories of both Europe and Japan. Miyazaki's examination of Jiro Horikoshi--whose life *The Wind Rises* is based on, and who was a prominent designer of airplanes for Japan in the second world war--does less to engage with Japan's fascist history, or colonial violence of the period, seeing instead the film as a meditation on art in the context of war. The modern in *Kiki's Delivery Service* has an air of utopianism that hides some of the more destructive histories that are associated with its ideologies.
