title: Kiki's Delivery Service Video Essay Response

The video essay “Kiki’s Delivery Service: The Millenial Starving Artist” by The Take, analyzes the movie Kiki’s Delivery Service by Miyazaki. Kiki’s Delivery Service tells the story of a young magical girl who moves to a large city to become a witch-in-training. She has the ability to fly, and in order to make money while living abroad, she opens a flying delivery service. The video essay argues that Kiki’s abilities as a witch and her attempt and struggle to monetize them can be an allegory for creative young adults in the working world. Magic becomes a stand-in for creativity. This is seen through Kiki excelling at a particular magical skill, her flying, which can be seen as an art form. Furthermore, Kiki’s Delivery Service insinuates that there are other kinds of magic when Kiki meets another witch on her way to the city who specializes in fortune telling. This other type of magic can be a metaphor for another type of art form from Kiki’s, much like dance and music, or writing and visual art. This allegory is important because Kiki’s struggles to find a way to enjoy her passion, flying, while monetizing it and not becoming burned out can help or inspire creative individuals who are looking to make their creative passions their career, and can also help those individuals if they do encounter or experience burnout themselves. 

In Kiki’s Delivery Service, Kiki eventually experiences burnout from monetizing her passion for flying by creating her flying delivery service. Though having a delivery service is not necessarily what she had envisioned for herself while living in the city, this was a way for her to be able to continue her passion of flying while making money for it. However, her burnout comes about through her realization that she works very hard for very little compensation, both emotionally as well as financially. The people of the city are not used to witches and therefore undervalue the services she provides with her flying abilities, so she has a low satisfaction while doing her delivery runs. Kiki’s feeling of losing her passion for flying is exacerbated when she actually loses the ability to fly, as well as other magical abilities such as talking to her cat, Jiji. Taking Kiki’s ability to fly as a metaphor for creative pursuits, the creative person who works hard on monetizing their passions can eventually completely lose the desire to do what they loved before. This is because their former passion has now turned into a chore instead of something to do for personal fulfillment. Kiki’s loss of the ability to fly can be likened to writer’s block, or a creative block in any field.

Kiki’s friend Ursula, who is a painter, gives her advice on how to overcome her flyer’s block. Her quote, which has become an internationally famous one, states: “Take long walks, look at the scenery, doze off at noon, don’t even think about flying. And then, pretty soon you’ll be flying again.” This advice can be applied to all creatives who are hoping to work or are currently working in a creative industry. If artists and those who wish to work creatively, whether through traditional arts careers like music, dance or writing, or through fields that are less commonly thought of as being traditionally creative, such as cooking, wish to overcome creative block, the advice to stop and allow oneself to rest and percolate new ideas may be better than simply forcing oneself to work harder. If constantly being forced to work when already feeling burnt out, the burnout and creative block may worsen, much like how Kiki entirely lost her magical abilities, including flying, after she was already feeling exhausted from running her flying delivery service. 

My own experience somewhat mirrors that of Kiki’s in terms of her finding it more difficult to enjoy her passion once she had monetized it. In my own life, after working as a musician, not even as a career, but just as a “part time job” of my own making for personal enjoyment, I found it harder to enjoy the creative process and found it had become more of a chore to do anything related to the process of music, whether it was practicing or writing or promoting. In fact, the promotional aspect of being a musician was especially and surprisingly the most draining of all. I believe this is because promotion is something that many probably do not consider when setting out to make any amount of money off of music, or any other arts careers, for that matter. Promoting oneself as an artist is important to ensuring that there is an audience to receive one’s work, but the act of promotion itself is very draining and not creative in its own right.
