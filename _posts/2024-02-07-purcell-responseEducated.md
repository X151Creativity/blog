I want to start this blog post by expressing how well [Sara's blog post](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/01/25/thompson-welleducated.html) summarizes and reflects on Alfie Kohn's essay ["What it Means to Be Well Educated"](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/mean-well-educated-article/#:~:text=To%20be%20well%2Deducated%2C%20then%2C%20is%20to%20have%20the,sure%20that%20learning%20never%20ends.&text=*%20The%20standard%20retort%20from%20the,to%20particular%20items%20of%20knowledge.). From Sara's post:

>Alfie Kohn urges his readers to rethink their definition of a “well-educated person”. Instead of generalizing the term and giving it one simple definition, he suggests that we allow “well-educated” to be defined individually. When we look at it, each person qualifies differently: some people define it through attending top schools, while others define it based on whether a person continues to learn and educate themselves throughout their life. Furthermore, someone else could even define it based on the career or power that they hold in society. Ultimately, Kohn wants his readers to understand that the term “well-educated” is subjective, and we must allow it to stay that way.

Kohn's argument is one which has been popular in humanist traditions: to take something assumed to be **natural** and make it into something that is **socially constructed**. This rhetorical move comes from a desire to reform an idea (as it is practiced by a discipline, or school, or economic structure, or educational practice and so on . . .), through the description of this thing that is understood to be neutral or is otherwise unexamined in discussions on the topic. So Kohn is saying that "well-educated" is an idea that needs further examination, because our culture's assumptions about the concept harms the way education works.

With this in mind, Sara's response keys into an important implicit argument for Kohn. She writes,

>I caught myself contemplating what I personally think it means to be well-educated. The importance of education and learning varies from person to person, and I find it to be very important. Simply because I find education to be valuable, doesn’t mean that I feel as though people who didn’t seek post-secondary education or attend top schools are not well-educated. My childhood best friend made the decision last year to not attend college, yet she is very intelligent and is someone I consider to be well-educated. My opinion of her didn’t change because of that decision, but a lot of other’s opinions did.

The problem is not being well-educated, so much as **the kinds of education which are accepted by our culture.** Everyone in this class is pursuing a degree, because that degree implies a level of education. "College educated" is short hand for "smart" or "capable" in hiring circles, which then means that any person who doesn't have access to or can't afford that education is at a disadvantage as compared to someone who does have one. Moreover, it means, as Sara discusses in her blog post, that people are incentivized to game the system, so as to improve their social and cultural standing:

>In our society we try to classify education through standardized test scores, grades, memorization of facts that honestly we rarely use again, and following rubrics. Being well-educated in its current state means checking boxes, yet all of us don’t fit into those same boxes. I sat through countless standardized tests, and although I scored well on most, I felt pressured to do even better. . . . Is this a fair way to assess students? Does that even prepare them for the world?
