There is a very slippery, problematic thing about Susan Sontag's essay "Against Interpretation": it challenges us to engage with a creative work in a way that all of our training--our schooling, our understanding of art from books and TV, our personal understanding of what it means to *make art*--has taught us. Art is supposed to mean something, right? If there is no meaning, then what is the point.

I want to point to both Wade and John's blog posts, because they do a good job distilling the works. [John writes](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/01/28/Sipchen-Interpretation.html),

>The core of Sontag’s argument revolves around the statement that interpretation is, probably more often than not, substituted for subjective experience with a work. She argues that the need to interpret symbols or find hidden messages within art leads us away from the artwork. In her argument Against interpretation Sontag argues, critics and the audience subject themselves to poor artistic encounters by converting them into just thinking more rationally.

Wade talks about this as well, [writing](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/01/26/Hall-AgainstInterpretations.html): 

>Susan Sontag’s “Against Interpretation” main point is to convince the audience to enjoy the beauty of things (artwork) instead of looking for the underlying meaning. You look at a picture or painting or artwork and think various of hour or even days on how or why the artwork was created. This idea of finding the hidden meaning of the artwork might take away from the beauty of the artwork is the main reason for writing this article."

What John and Wade are getting at, and which is spot on regarding Sontag's essay is that the things that may draw us to an art piece--what it makes us feel, what it stirs in us--is undermined by the interpretive work. From English literature **Hamlet** if is about procrastination and a lesson against that, it hides the other ways we can relate to and understand the Danish prince and his own anxieties about mortality, agency, and self actualization. Interpretation becomes a way to sequester the work within predetermined frameworks.

Wade discusses in his [blog post](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/01/26/Hall-AgainstInterpretations.html) the importance of subjectivity. He talks about how everyone comes from a different background and different place in their life, and thus they would have a different experience.[^1]

I want to point to John's critique of Sontag, later in [his blog post](https://x151creativity.github.io/blog/2024/01/28/Sipchen-Interpretation.html). He writes,

> She passionately denies interpretation as such, there is no clear alternative to engaging with the art proposed by her. The reader remains in doubt as to how one can admire and discuss art, without falling into the trap of interpretation.This lack of clarity raises a valid concern: However, since we rule out interpretation what other avenues for engagement do we have and how can one verbalize a response to art without developing analytical frameworks.

I don't think Sontag has a good response to this critique, because she is so concerned with pointing out this bias toward interpretation. The problem is *we are trained to think that something must mean something* that a poem can't be just about flowers, or a painting can't just be a black square, or a film can't just be a fun time at the movies. Approaching these things without the interpretive framework means that we have to reassess how and why we even like creative work, and whether it provides value at all.



Footnotes:

[^1]: There is a helpful concept that originates out of law known as intersectionality—-a knowledge that everyone is born into or lives with a series of different classifiers that help define their perspective. Intersectionality has been really helpful in critiques of the white-dominated feminism of the 1970s through the 1990s, because those movements did less to serve the black, queer, or differently abled women who also needed to be heard in those movements. Intersectionality allows people to understand themselves as a network of interrelated identities which may overlap with others, rather than having an overarching term--like "female" or "male", or "white" or "Black"--which would otherwise exclude them.
