"Against Interpretation" by Susan Sontag
The approach to art criticism being associated with the habit of interpreting art works is challenged in Susan Sontag’s article Against Interpretation. The main thesis of Sontag is that undue focus on interpretation and analysis takes away from the inherent worthiness and force of art. In her thought-provoking essay, she urges readers not to cut and analyze art but rather seek a more direct form of engagement with aesthetic life.
The core of Sontag’s argument revolves around the statement that interpretation is, probably more often than not, substituted for subjective experience with a work. She argues that the need to interpret symbols or find hidden messages within art leads us away from the artwork. In her argument Against interpretation Sontag argues, critics and the audience subject themselves to poor artistic encounters by converting them into just thinking more rationally.
However, Sontag’s critique is not a dismissal of interpretation but rather, an indictment of the culture that favors intellect over sensation. According to her, the modern fascination with symbolic decoding and meaning extraction from artworks has overshadowed the attention that should be paid to immediate aesthetic perception. However, she argues that this tendency limits the transformative power of art which becomes a sphere for merely intellectual games rather than force able to change perceptions and feelings.
All the essay addressed is that today's art must be interpreted through a lens of meaning originating primarily from historical, political or cultural situations. Sontag questions the notion that art needs justification via interpretation, implying that this approach severely limits the range of potential engagements with artwork. By rejecting the concept that art must communicate a particular message or follow some established narrative, she emphasizes an unconstrained approach to intelligent participation in aesthetics.
In a nutshell, I believe one could paraphrase Sontag’s essay as an ardent call to release art from the shackles of interpretation and encourage people to interact with it in a more visceral way without attempting to decode symbols within.
In response to Sontag’s thesis, my argument is consistent with her demand for a shift in the approach taken by art. I find it convincing that her argument against overinterpretation is based on the facts about beauty and power of art lying in responses produced by emotion or senses. In my opinion, art should not be seen as a puzzle to solve or a code to crack but rather celebrated for its capacity of stirring emotions and throwing out challenges that require deep introspection.
One instance in Sontag’s essay to which I could relate notes that the search for hidden meanings might be exercised as intellectual ability. She makes a stand on how art interpretation can be seen as a status symbol where people around do not just interpret but show their intellectual coat. This insight resonated with me because it exposed the risk of converting art admiration into an intellectual sport rather than a personal emotional adventure. This is based on my personal life and I can remember times of pressure when I was expressing 
deep meanings reflected in the works to match academic or social qualifications. Sontag’s essay is a warning that these pressures can strip away the raw, original feelings we might have about art. It provokes a reassessment of the socially constructed conventions concerning art criticism and interpretation.
On the other side of Sontag’s argument she has a focal point of confusion. She passionately denies interpretation as such, there is no clear alternative to engaging with the art proposed by her. The reader remains in doubt as to how one can admire and discuss art, without falling into the trap of interpretation.This lack of clarity raises a valid concern: However, since we rule out interpretation what other avenues for engagement do we have and how can one verbalize a response to art without developing analytical frameworks. Sontag’s 
essay is powerful and thought-provoking, but it fails to account for the practical problems of negotiating between analysis and direct experience. Though discouraging her readers against interpretation, she leaves them somehow hanging in the dark seeking an alternative approach without specifying what such a recipe is.
To conclude, Susan Sontag offers an interesting analysis of the modern “dissect and decode artworks” culture in her article ‘Against Interpretation’. Her thesis calls readers to reconsider their relationship with art, asking them if it is the sensual or intellectual conception that matters. In agreement with Sontag’s proposal to shift our perception, I believe the realities of involving oneself in art without falling into interpreting it is the best way to see art.
