The TV writers strike is an issue that is still being discussed till this day. There has been a significant change in the way that television decides to broadcast their shows. In the modern era, we are seeing a very big shift from watching shows on television to watching them on different streaming platforms, such as Netflix or Hulu. As a result of this shift, writers have to work harder to find a job and maintain a job. There is less work for writers to do, and they find themselves moving jobs very frequently. Additionally, there has been a lack of residuals for the writers who are creating these shows. In 1960, there was a big writers strike concerning the lack of residuals for the writers of these shows. Certain writers were feeling like they were being underpaid and treated unfairly when the show that they created started to gain popularity. As a result of this strike, writers started to gain more residuals and started to get the credit that they deserve. However, after many years of development in the television industry, there is still an issue with how writers are being treated. Writers are getting underpaid for the work that they are doing towards these shows, and they are not getting the respect or the pay that they deserve.

The evolution of television broadcasting has brought about significant changes in the way audiences consume content. Streaming platforms have revolutionized the viewing experience, offering a variety of shows and movies at the click of a button. This accessibility has led to a surge in demand for original content, providing writers with new opportunities to showcase their talent. However, it has also intensified competition within the industry, making it increasingly difficult for writers to secure stable employment.

One of the most significant challenges facing writers today is the lack of job security. With the rise of streaming platforms, traditional television networks are no longer the sole providers of entertainment. As a result, writers often find themselves navigating a fragmented and unpredictable job market, where project durations are short-lived, and contracts are not lasting. This instability not only creates financial uncertainty but also takes a toll on the creative process, as writers are constantly under pressure to secure their next gig.

Additionally, the issue of residuals continues to be a massive issue for writers. Residuals, which are payments made to writers for the reuse of their work, are crucial for ensuring fair compensation in an industry where success is often measured by longevity. However, despite their importance, residuals remain an issue with many writers feeling they are not fairly compensated for the ongoing success of their work. This disparity in compensation can have significant consequences, affecting not only the financial well-being of writers but also their motivation and passion.

Overall, There needs to be a change in the way that writers are treated. Writers need to be compensated for the work that they are doing, and when that work succeeds greatly, there should be a fair compensation. Writers are the backbone of these stories, and without them there would be no entertainment. The streaming industry is taking advantage of these writers are not getting the respect that they deserve. Most of the credit when a show succeeds goes to the producer and the actors of the show, and the writers are left behind to move onto another job. There is still a growing issue in the television industry that needs to be changed. Writers need to be treated fairly and given the respect that they have earned.
