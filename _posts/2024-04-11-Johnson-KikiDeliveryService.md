# SUMMARY
The film “Kiki’s Delivery Service” created by Hayao Miyazaki is an eyecatching and beautifully animated film about a young witch in training named Kiki. When Kiki turned thirteen she had to move away from home and start her witch training by herself in a new city. Once entering the city she was not met with the warmest welcome at first and felt alienated for the start. Later in the film she decides to start a delivery service because of her special talent of being able to fly, this turns out to be a big success. But throughout the movie, she slowly gets depressed and burnt out from all the work she does and ends up losing her magic. Later Kiki runs into a friend from earlier in the film who teaches her that it is okay to take breaks from things she loves as well as overall taking care of her health. Lastly, near the end of the film, another one of Kiki’s friends is in danger and she quickly regains her magic to help him. 

# Monetization of Creativity & Talents
Kiki’s Delivery Service has many strong themes that people of today can highly relate to. One of the biggest would have to be the monetization of creativity. In today’s world of late-stage capitalism, it can be hard to afford the necessities of life, this is even more prevalent in people who work in or wish to work in creative fields and or have creative hobbies. As it becomes more difficult to live we have to find ways to make ends meet, this is where hustle culture comes in. Having a second job, running a small business, or in this case, monetizing your creativity and talents. Going back to Kiki, this is a prime example of what she has to do in her current situation. Because Kiki needs money to support herself and not be a burden she starts monetizing her talent of flying to make ends meet, this later turns around on her.

# Burnout
Because of Kiki’s need to earn money, she starts a delivery service. By using her talent of flying she is able to do what she loves and make a living as well. Though this sounds great in practice in reality she starts to feel overwhelmed and disconnected from the experience with the majority of the recipients of her deliveries not being grateful for what they have received. With all of the factors combined Kiki falls into a depression and loses her magic, taking away what made her feel special. This is very prevalent in our world today creatives have to take their talents and creativity and monetize it, (sometimes for free) this constant cycle of creating for not yourself but for others until you eventually burn out is a big issue that can not necessarily be fixed but can be managed.



# Breaks
Near the end of the film while Kiki is experiencing burnout she is scared that she will not be able to fly again, and without her flying then who is she. This is a common experience that creatives go through during burnout when they feel like they do not love the craft anymore or feel like they lost their talent. Kiki is later taught that not doing anything related to flying or magic is what is best for her, walking, listening to music, or just talking to someone. Taking a break can overall be what is best for you in the long run. Sooner or later you will be able to do what you love it i just a matter of time. Taking a break and enjoying life is what ends up working best for Kiki when she needed her magic the most she was able to fly again. She learned from that experience and grew as a person and a witch doing her best to have a balance in her life. 

# Conclusion
What we can take away from Kiki’s Delivery Service in our modern age is that even with the need of monetizing our creativity, talent, and work there is a way that we can still love our crafts while able to manage and or avoid burnout. Through recreation or even just doing nothing we can find a balance between our love for a craft and the possible need to monetize it in our hustle culture.
