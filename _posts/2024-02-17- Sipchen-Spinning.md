 Spinning By: Tillie Walden
 For this weeks post, I'll be talking about and reviewing Spinning by Tillie Walden a captivating graphic memoir that took me on a nostalgic journey through the author's coming-of-age experiences. As I delved into the pages, I couldn't help but be drawn into the beautifully illustrated world that Walden created to tell her personal story. The use of the graphic novel format added a unique and creative layer to the narrative, allowing me to visually witness the author's growth and self-discovery.
 From the beginning of the book, Walden's exploration of her experiences within the competitive world of figure skating were very intresting to me. Along with the great story the read to read pages with illustrations brought to life the physical and emotional demands of figure skating, providing a easy and fun narrative about the competitivness of the sport. The graphic novel format also with its fusion of words and images, allowed me to witness the author's growth, struggles, and triumphs in a uniquely immersive way.
 One of the key themes that the storyline portrayed was identity and self- realization. The entire book focuses on Tillie figuring out who she is and in the skating competition captured the essence of the challenges of growing up in an all-embracing world. The emphasis on fitting in, navigating own passions, and the twisters of personal relationships were seamlessly flawed into the plot. She conveyed this way of living by using words that were different and drawings that were evocative to show how significant it is to follow the path of your own self even in the presence of expectations of society.
 As I was reading the book, I couldn't help but have the theme of resilience constantly keep coming up in my head as well. As Walden stuck to figure skating in spite of all the odds, her journey became an exemplary showcase of the strength of one's mind if they don't give up. It was because of this the story was written really focusing on the list of the triumphs and failures, each contributing to the gradual growth and self-discovement of the narrator. Still, the resilience, visualized and verbalized became very real and soul-touching to me, reminding me of the fact that challenge belongs to the human experience.
 Another very important aspect of the book was how it was layed out in a grpahic novel style. Walden's artistic choices played a significant role in conveying the book's emotional depth. The muted color palette used throughout the graphic memoir created a somber and introspective atmosphere, perfectly complementing the introspective nature of the narrative. The use of visual metaphors, such as the spinning motion of figure skating, added a layer of symbolism that enriched the overall reading experience.
Looking back on the book, I am convinced its message is far reaching from its figure skating environment. Spinning echoes a call to reflect on your own quests for the true you in the process of self-discovery. It shows our worth even if we deviate from the planned paths.
Finally, Spinning by Tillie Walden represents a perceptive disclosure of the issues of identity, strength and awkwardness of the teenage years. The fun memoir's powerful presence of a captivating story and haunting art throughout the book is still vivid on my mind. It led me to a place where I recalled my own activities and I understood the importance of holding with the originality. It's because of this I can take from this book that the universal lessons about the courage, self-reflection, and searching for truth is something we should all be searching for in our lives.
