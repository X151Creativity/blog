Tillie Walden's "Spinning" tells the tale of her youth and overcoming difficulties. Even though this is Walden's life narrative, many young people might identify with alienation or unfitness. You also have the challenges of being a student and participating in extracurricular activities on top of those emotions. All those elements contribute to burnout, a central issue in Tillie Walden's "Spinning." Tillie Walden's graphic memoir "Spinning" explores her path of self-discovery and her experiences as a competitive figure skater. Identity, youth, family, friendship, and pursuing one's passion are some of the things Walden talks about in her memoir. Walden gives readers a peek into the demanding world of figure skating and the challenges of navigating adolescence and LGBTQ+ identity. 

Walden describes how anxiety can play a significant role in performing tasks. An example of this in the book is when Walden's character forgets her figure skating routine. She shows a series of boxes, some going completely black, which I feel is an accurate depiction of what having anxiety feels like. Walden feels all this pressure from her parents, coaches, and competition. Not only is she dealing with all of those pressures, but she's also an openly gay person in Texas. With all these challenges, she can barely keep her head above water. Although this was a very vulnerable time for her, Walden felt it was necessary to write this book because many people, especially students, resonated with her experience. 

As college students, we often find ourselves grappling with anxiety and burnout, much like Walden in her memoir. These emotions can become overwhelming, but as students, we feel we don't have the luxury of dwelling on them. The stressors we face as college students are often trivialized on social media and seen as normal. But they're not. Society needs to stop normalizing burnout. Students, particularly those from marginalized communities, face constant pressure to be perfect from their families and often feel they can't make mistakes. These are issues that need to be discussed, and 'Spinning' by Tillie Walden is a memoir that sparks these conversations. 

The central idea of "Spinning" is the investigation of identity and self-discovery amid competitive pressures and cultural expectations. Reflecting on Walden's career as a figure skater, Walden wrestles with issues of sexuality, identity, and personal fulfillment. She highlights the importance of following one's passions and embracing one's true self amid difficulty. Because it clarifies the complexity of identity creation and the influence of cultural expectations on personal development, Walden's memoir is significant. She questions conventional ideas of femininity and masculinity via her story, emphasizing the value of accepting and expressing oneself.

Tillie Walden's memoir 'Spinning' is a deeply insightful and touching narrative that resonates with readers on multiple levels. Walden's exploration of identity, self-discovery, and the pursuit of passion is both realistic and moving. From the very beginning, I was drawn into Walden's story as a reader. Her candid storytelling and vibrant artwork combine to create a compelling narrative that portrays the highs and lows of her journey as a figure skater and as a young woman coming to terms with her identity. The universality of her experiences makes 'Spinning' a memoir that can be appreciated by a wide range of readers.

Furthermore, I related to Walden's examination of LGBTQ+ identification and her experiences accepting her sexuality. I found Walden's tale to be a strong reminder of the value of self-acceptance and self-expression as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Her self-discovery journey is a tribute to the human spirit's tenacity and the strength of embracing one's true self. My impression of "Spinning" was that Walden did an excellent job of capturing the complexity of identity creation. Walden struggles with issues of femininity and masculinity throughout the memoir, frequently feeling that she doesn't neatly fall into either camp. For many readers, including myself, she struggles to balance her sense of self with society's expectations. 

"Spinning" by Tillie Walden is a graphic memoir that explores her experiences as a competitive figure skater, highlighting themes of identity, youth, family, friendship, and pursuing passion. It provides a glimpse into the demanding world of figure skating and the challenges of navigating adolescence and LGBTQ+ identity, highlighting the experiences of many young people. All things considered, "Spinning" is an exquisitely written book that provides a compelling investigation of identity, self-discovery, and pursuing one's passion. Walden creates an intensely personal and universally relatable story through her openness, vulnerability, and powerful artwork. This narrative highlights the importance of staying true to yourself and following your passions despite obstacles.
